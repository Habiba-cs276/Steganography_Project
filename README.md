# Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of steganography using Python. The project focuses on hiding text and other data within digital images by manipulating pixel values (LSB). It includes functions for both encoding (hiding) and decoding (revealing) messages.
# Features
Hide Data: Embed a secret text message within an image (.png or .jpg).

Show Data: Reveal and extract the hidden message from an encoded image.

Image Handling: A user-friendly interface to open and save images.

File Management: Automatically saves the output image as a hidden.png file.

# Technologies Used
1- Python 3.x

2- Tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit.

3- Pillow (PIL): For image manipulation and processing.

4- Stegano: A Python library for steganography.
